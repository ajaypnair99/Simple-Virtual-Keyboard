#Simple-Virtual-Keyboard

There is a installer in the SVK Installer>Debug file 

The default directory is Program Files(x86)\SimpleVirtualKeyboard\

The Windows key might still have some problems , so I won't recommend using the key. 

Clicking on The CLEAR button will clear the previously clicked button display in the bottom left.

Clicking on EXTEND will enable a numpad view. NOTE : RightClick might not work. 

There are 3 branches , Master , Advancedkeyboard , transparent 

The advanced keyboard will have some additional functionality and the Transparent branch is same as advanced keyboard with transparent keys
